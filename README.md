Image Encryption and Decryption Using Python (AES Algorithm)
This project implements a robust image encryption and decryption system using Python and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. It focuses on securing digital images to ensure confidentiality and protection from unauthorized access during transmission and storage.

 ðŸ”’ Key Features
- Implements AES encryption and decryption for image security.
- Supports multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP).
- Protects sensitive images from unauthorized access and tampering.
- User-friendly interface for seamless encryption and decryption processes.
- Efficient performance with minimal computational overhead.

 ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Develop robust encryption algorithms to transform image data into unreadable formats.
- Implement decryption mechanisms to recover the original image without data loss.
- Ensure high-security standards suitable for applications like medical imaging, military data, and multimedia systems.

 ðŸ’» Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Cryptography Libraries (AES encryption)
- NumPy, Pillow (Image Processing)

 âœ… How It Works
1. Select an image for encryption.
2. Encrypt the image using AES and generate a secure cipher.
3. Decrypt the cipher to restore the original image using the same key.

 ðŸ“ˆ Applications
- Secure communication systems
- Medical and military imaging
- Multimedia security solutions
